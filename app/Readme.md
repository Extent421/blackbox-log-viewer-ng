# Betaflight Enhanced Blackbox Explorer

![Main explorer interface](app/screenshots/main-interface.jpg)

This tool allows you to open logs recorded by Betaflight's Blackbox feature as a native application. You can seek through the log to examine graphed values at each timestep. If you have a flight video, you can load that in as well and it'll be played behind the log.

## Installation

As native applications, the simplest installation is to download the installer file and execute/run it.
* For MacOS, download the **.DMG** file and open it; drag the Betaflight Blackbox Explorer Icon into the applications folder and run it as a normal Mac application.
